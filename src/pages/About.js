                    Hi! My name is Elliott Payne, I am a Full Stack Web Developer from Austin, TX with extensive knowledge in HTML, CSS, JS, JQuery, Node.js, Express, SQL, MongoDb, ReactJs, Github, and Bootstrap. I live in Austin with my girlfriend, my dog Eleanor, and our budgie pudgy. I grew up overseas on military bases, mostly in Europe, where my parents worked as elementary school teachers. I attended Texas State University and graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Recreation Administration. For almost a decade I worked and managed for Omni Hotels & Resorts untill I was able to persue my passion in Coding and Web Development.
